# AI Review & Product Scraper API

This project provides an API for scraping product data, analyzing reviews, storing and retrieving sentiment information,
and performing semantic searches using Pinecone.

## Getting Started

### 1. Start Services with Docker using "make"

Before starting, you need to change the name of .env_example file to .env everything will work in mock mode and then:

```bash
   make up
```

To see docker logs:

```bash
   make logs
```

This command launches the following services:

* FastAPI app ([http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000))
* PostgreSQL database
* Redis server

## üîß Manual Testing Using Mock Data

You can test this API manually using mock data generated in `scraper.py`. Here is a step-by-step test guide.

---

## üîç API Testing Flow

1. **Scrape Product Data**
   `POST /api/v1/scrape-product`
   Scrapes and ingests a mock product.

```bash
   curl -X 'POST' \
     'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/scrape-product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsmartphone-galaxy-s23' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -d ''
```

2. **Get List of All Products**
   `GET /api/v1/products`

```bash
   curl -X 'GET' \
     'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/products?limit=10&offset=0' \
     -H 'accept: application/json'
```

3. **Get Detailed Product with Reviews**
   `GET /api/v1/products/{product_id}`

```bash
   curl -X 'GET' \
     'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/products/1' \
     -H 'accept: application/json'
```

4. **Semantic Review Search**
   `GET /api/v1/search-reviews?q=...`

```bash
   curl -X 'GET' \
     'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search-reviews?query=camera&limit=10&min_similarity=0.1' \
     -H 'accept: application/json'
```

5. **Filter Reviews by Sentiment**
   `GET /api/v1/reviews/by-sentiment/{sentiment}`

Positive sentiment:

```bash
   curl -X 'GET' \
     'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/reviews/by-sentiment/positive?limit=50' \
     -H 'accept: application/json'
```

Negative sentiment:

```bash
   curl -X 'GET' \
     'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/reviews/by-sentiment/negative?limit=50' \
     -H 'accept: application/json'
```

Neutral sentiment:

```bash
   curl -X 'GET' \
     'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/reviews/by-sentiment/neutral?limit=50' \
     -H 'accept: application/json'
```

6. **Sentiment Statistics Analytics**
   `GET /api/v1/analytics/sentiment-stats`

```bash
   curl -X 'GET' \
     'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analytics/sentiment-stats' \
     -H 'accept: application/json'
```
